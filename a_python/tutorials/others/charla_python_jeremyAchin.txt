Definición de Data Science (Drew Conway)
	Hacking skills (programación +  SO)
		write code and get the data wherever it is. Clean and explore the data and deliver the result in a web app for instance.
	Math Stats knowledge
		Using Machine Learning or any other predictive model, what technique to use, validate the data with diferent model strategies
	Domain knowledge of the field
		knowing the data
		how was storage originaly, how does behave inside the model.
		

Kaggle competitions models: radom forest, bossted trees, SVM, linear model (sparks), decision trees (for exploring the data). 

Neural networks/Deep Learning are good for specific class of problems.
